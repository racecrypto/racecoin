Protocol Documentation - 0.12.2
=====================================

This document describes the protocol extensions for all additional functionality build into the Race protocol. This doesn't include any of the Bitcoin, neither of the Dash protocol, which has been left intact in the Race project.

For more information about the core Bitcoin protocol, please see https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title#Protocol_documentation&action#edit
For more information about the Dash protocol, please see https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/dash-docs/protocol-documentation.md
